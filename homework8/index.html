            <p>My name is Vlad Musienko, I'm a web designer. I love to draw and all that is connected with the design.
                In
                this area a long time ago and during this time I managed to create several successful projects used by
                people all over the world. </p>
            <p>I love the simplicity in the design of web sites. As I see it,people, it's like my work. Naturally do not
                want to rest on our laurels and will continue further studies to improve soybean skills, creating new
                interesting creative projects.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    template.
                    <p>Lately, I often create templates for WordPress. The portfolio is the presentation and the
                        opportunity
                        to buy them on the site Themeforest.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    brand.
                    <p>Creating a brand is a very complex process aimed at the creation and positioning the unique
                        persons
                        of the company, its products and services.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    dream.
                    <p>Everyone is able to destroy the dream, but not everyone is able to create it. I try to help
                        people in
                        its definition as a person and specialist.</p>
